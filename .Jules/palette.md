## 2025-05-22 - Icon Links Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only links (using `react-icons`) are common in this app but lack `aria-label` or accessible text, making them invisible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` to any `IconLink` or icon-only button to ensure screen reader accessibility.
